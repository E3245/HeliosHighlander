; HELIOS Issue #39
; Adding markup maps to existing maps is complicated to do via INI editing when considering DefaultPlots/Parcels.ini and other mods attempting to do the same.
; This is where AdditionalMarkupMaps and its function comes in via injection of new markup maps/objectives at runtime.
;
; To take advantage of this, define the map that should be injected in `MapName`, then start adding the markup maps as usual.
; ObjectiveTag cannot be blank since the maps need to align with the Plot's/Parcel's ObjectiveTag array. Doing so will cause the function to reject that markup.
; Duplicate ObjectiveTags can co-exist, but only the first one will get picked.
